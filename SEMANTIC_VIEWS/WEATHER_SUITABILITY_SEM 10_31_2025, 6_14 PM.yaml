    description: This view provides a suitability score for outdoor activities based on weather forecasts, taking into account precipitation probability and wind speed. The score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating more favorable conditions. The view also includes a recommendation for outdoor activities based on the precipitation probability, suggesting "Good for outdoor" if the probability is below 60% and "Better indoor" otherwise.
